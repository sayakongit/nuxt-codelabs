# üöÄ Sangnet | Connecting blood, saving life

This repository contains a project that combines Django, Django REST Framework, React, and Vite to create a web application with a robust backend and a dynamic frontend.

# Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- `backend`: Contains the Django application responsible for handling API requests and database interactions.
- `frontend`: Contains the React application built using Vite, providing a modern and efficient development experience for the frontend.

# Backend (Django) üì¶

The backend is built using Django and Django REST Framework, providing a RESTful API to communicate with the frontend. The key features of the backend include:

- API endpoints to manage various resources, such as users, data models, and more.
- Integration with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store and retrieve data.
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
- Custom views, serializers, and models to tailor the API to your project's needs.

### Setting Up the Backend üõ†Ô∏è

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Setup the environment variables:

   Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and update all the env variables.

   - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` is your gmail.
   - `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` will be the App Password in your gmail. Refer this [doc](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) to create your app password.
   - `DATABASE_URL` is typically a external Postgres db URL hosted on cloud. You can create a free one on [Render](https://docs.render.com/databases).
   - **PS:** If you don't want to setup a cloud db, you can still use a local db for development purpose. For that uncomment line 88-93 in `core/settings.py` and comment out line 95-97

3. **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Optional, but recommended):**

   Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```
   pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   ./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
   ```

4. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
   ```
7. Use `http://localhost:8000` as the API base URL.

# Frontend (React with Vite) ‚öõÔ∏è

The frontend is built using React and Vite, providing fast development and hot module replacement for efficient code changes. The frontend offers a user-friendly interface to interact with the API provided by the Django backend.

### Setting Up the Frontend üõ†Ô∏è

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the required Node packages:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
3. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the frontend.
